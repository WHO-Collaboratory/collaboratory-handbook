### Set up MFA (Multi-factor authentication)

After the successful submission of all the requested information on the sign-up page, you will need to provide a code which you can obtain from an Authenticator app.
On-screen instructions are shown to guide you through the activation process and obtaining a code from an Authenticator app.

:::{attention}
For security reasons, users are required to set up MFA.  
Note:  2FA (Two-factor authentication) can also be referred to as MFA (Multi-factor Authentication).

:::{note}
You can use either the [**Google Authenticator**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US&pli=1) or [**Microsoft Authenticator**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/download-microsoft-authenticator-351498fc-850a-45da-b7b6-27e523b8702a) **mobile app**. If you do not have it installed on your phone, you must do that first.
