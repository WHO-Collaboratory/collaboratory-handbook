## Change email address

**Q: I would like to use a different email address for Collaboratory. How do I do that?**

The best way to proceed is as follows:  
1. Open a new account on Collaboratory with the new email address
2. {ref}`contact_us` with the below information, and we will put in an IT ticket to “merge” the profile accounts. Let us know which email address is the preferred one to keep.
